# SecurityTestingTool-STT

Welcome to **SecurityTestingTool-STT**, a comprehensive suite of tools designed for conducting security tests on web, software, and hardware platforms. This repository includes all the utilities I have developed and use for executing penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and exploit creation.

## Purpose

These tools are primarily intended for use in professional engagements, including both commissioned attacks and voluntary bug bounty programs on platforms like HackerOne and others. The goal is to identify and report potential vulnerabilities, contributing to a safer and more secure digital landscape.

## Features

- **Web Exploitation**: Tools for identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
- **Software Testing**: Utilities for fuzzing, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation of software applications.
- **Hardware Attacks**: Tools designed to target hardware systems, including embedded devices, with a focus on firmware extraction and exploitation.
- **Network Security**: Scripts for testing network vulnerabilities, including Wi-Fi attacks and packet analysis.
